# Temperature Sensor 
The Temperature Sensor ***LM35*** series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly proportional to the Centigrade temperature.

The LM35 device has an advantage over linear temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large constant voltage from the output to obtain convenient Centigrade scaling. The LM35 device does not require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of ±¼°C at room temperature and ±¾°C over a full −55°C to 150°C temperature range.

## Arduino Code
```C
float temp;
int tempPin = 0;

void setup() {
   Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
   temp = analogRead(tempPin);
   // read analog volt from sensor and save to variable temp
   temp = temp * 0.48828125;
   // convert the analog volt to its temperature equivalent
   Serial.print("TEMPERATURE = ");
   Serial.print(temp); // display temperature value
   Serial.print("*C");
   Serial.println();
   delay(1000); // update sensor reading each one second
}
```

## Code to Note
LM35 sensor has three terminals - Vs, Vout and GND. We will connect the sensor as follows −

 - Connect the +Vs to +5v on your Arduino board.
 - Connect Vout to Analog0 or A0 on Arduino board.
 - Connect GND with GND on Arduino.
   
The ***Analog to Digital Converter*** (ADC) converts analog values into a digital approximation based on the formula ADC Value = sample * 1024 / reference voltage (+5v). So with a +5 volt reference, the digital approximation will be equal to input voltage * 205.

## Result
You will see the temperature display on the serial port monitor which is updated every second.
