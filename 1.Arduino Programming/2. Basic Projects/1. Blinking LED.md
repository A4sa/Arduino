To start, we will work on blinking an LED, the Hello World of microcontrollers. It is as simple as turning a light on and off. 

## Components Required
  - 1 × Breadboard
  - 1 × Arduino Uno R3
  - 1 × LED
  - 1 × 330Ω Resistor
  - 2 × Jumper

## Procedure
Follow the circuit diagram and hook up the components on the breadboard as shown in the image given below.

- To find out the polarity of an **LED**, look at it closely. The shorter of the two legs, towards the flat edge of the bulb indicates the negative terminal.

- Components like **resistors** need to have their terminals bent into 90° angles in order to fit the breadboard sockets properly. You can also cut the terminals shorter.    



## Sketch
Open the Arduino IDE software on your computer. Coding in the Arduino language will control your circuit. Open the new sketch File by clicking New.

## Arduino Code 

```C 
/*
   Blink
   Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
*/

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board

void setup() {  // initialize digital pin 13 as an output.
   pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

void loop() {
   digitalWrite(2, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
   delay(1000); // wait for a second
   digitalWrite(2, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
   delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
```
