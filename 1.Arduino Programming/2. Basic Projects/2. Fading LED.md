
This example demonstrates the use of the analogWrite() function in fading an LED off. AnalogWrite uses pulse width modulation (PWM), turning a digital pin on and off very quickly with different ratios between on and off, to create a fading effect.

## Components Required
  - 1 × Breadboard
  - 1 × Arduino Uno R3
  - 1 × LED
  - 1 × 330Ω Resistor
  - 2 × Jumper

## Procedure
Follow the circuit diagram and hook up the components on the breadboard as shown in the image given below.

- To find out the polarity of an **LED**, look at it closely. The shorter of the two legs, towards the flat edge of the bulb indicates the negative terminal.

- Components like **resistors** need to have their terminals bent into 90° angles in order to fit the breadboard sockets properly. You can also cut the terminals shorter.

/*
   Fade
   This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9 using the analogWrite() function.

   The analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if you want to change the pin you're using, be
   sure to use another PWM capable pin. On most Arduino, the PWM pins are identified with
   a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.
*/

int led = 9; // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0; // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5; // how many points to fade the LED by
// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:

void setup() {
   // declare pin 9 to be an output:
   pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:

void loop() {
   // set the brightness of pin 9:
   analogWrite(led, brightness);
   // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
   brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;
   // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
   if (brightness == 0 || brightness == 255) {
      fadeAmount = -fadeAmount ;
   }
   // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
   delay(300);
}
```
